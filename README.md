play-kotlin
===========

This is an example of using Kotlin with Play Framework 1.x.

This is not a reusable module (yet).

Note that we don't call Kotlin compiler from within running Play (as it does with Java),
but rely on already precompiled Kotlin classes by the IDE or build system.

A lot of work is still to be done.
